# Node API

In this folder we will have the part of the course that references to the API.

1. Let's start to set it up by running the command `npm init -y`
2. Then let's install these packages:

- `npm install --save express`
- `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
- `npm install --save body-parser`

3. Let's add swagger so we can have an UI to check our endpoints: `npm install express swagger-ui-express swagger-jsdoc`
